"Modules may appear in this chapter because they only cover a limited subset "
"of a problem space, and a more generally applicable solution is available "
"elsewhere in the standard library (for example, :mod:`getopt` covers the "
"very specific task of \"mimic the C :c:func:`!getopt` API in Python\", "
"rather than the broader command line option parsing and argument parsing "
"capabilities offered by :mod:`optparse` and :mod:`argparse`)."

"Alternatively, modules may appear in this chapter because they are "
"deprecated outright, and awaiting removal in a future release, or they are "
":term:`soft deprecated` and their use is actively discouraged in new "
"projects. With the removal of various obsolete modules through :pep:`594`, "
"there are currently no modules in this latter category."
